```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Libraries
```{r include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Read in the data
```{r include = TRUE}
statCast <- read.csv(paste(getwd(), "/data/statcast2017.csv", sep = ""))
bbref <- read.csv(paste(getwd(), "/data/bbref2017.csv", sep = ""))
```


## Joining the two datasets together with dplyr
```{r include=TRUE}
statCastName <- statCast %>% mutate(
  Name = paste(
    str_replace_all(
      first_name, " ", ""), 
    str_replace_all(
      last_name, " ", ""), 
    sep = " "))  

bsbl <- left_join(statCastName, bbref, by = "Name")
```


## EDA

```{r}
glimpse(bsbl)
```



```{r include = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# without applying this filter on the data set, there were
# a lot of players with too few plate appearances messing 
bsblSub <- bsbl %>% subset(attempts > 50)  

bsblSub %>% ggplot(aes(x = anglesweetspotpercent, y = avg_distance, color = attempts, alpha = 0.5)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Hit Distance as a funciton of launch angle sweet spot %" ,
    x = "Launch Angle Sweet Spot %",
    y = "Average Hit Distance (ft.)"
  )
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# plot batting average by average exit velocity, something that I could not do without
# having mergeed the datasets

bsblSub %>% ggplot(aes(x = BA, y = avg_hit_speed, color = barrels, alpha = 0.5)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs (
    title = "Average Hit Speed as a function of Batting Average",
    x = "Batting Average",
    y = "Average Hit Speed"
  )
```

```{r}
# t test
colorado <- bsbl %>% subset(Team == "Colorado")
everyoneElse <- bsbl %>% subset(Team != "Colorado")

t.test(colorado$avg_hit_speed, everyoneElse$avg_hit_speed)
```
