```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in the data
```{r include = TRUE}
statCast <- read.csv(paste(getwd(), "/data/statcast2017.csv", sep = ""))
bbref <- read.csv(paste(getwd(), "/data/bbref2017.csv", sep = ""))
```


## Joining the two datasets together with dplyr
```{r include=TRUE}
statCast <- statCast %>% mutate(Name = paste(first_name, last_name, sep = " "))  
bsbl <- left_join(statCast, bbref, by = "Name")

```


## EDA

##### Relationship between Launch angle sweet spot % and avg hit distance  
```{r include = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# without applying this filter on the data set, there were
# a lot of players with too few plate appearances messing 
statCastSub <- statCast %>% subset(attempts > 50)  

statCastSub %>% ggplot(aes(x = anglesweetspotpercent, y = avg_distance, color = attempts, alpha = 0.5)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "",
    x = "Launch Angle Sweet Spot %",
    y = "Average Hit Distance (ft.)"
  )
```
